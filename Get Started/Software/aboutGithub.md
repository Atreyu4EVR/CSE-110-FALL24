# Introduction to GitHub

This course will demonstrate the fundamentals of how to securely store, collaborate, and version control the code you're developing using GitHub.

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help developers manage and store their code. It provides a collaborative environment where developers can work together on projects, track changes, and manage their code effectively. GitHub is a crucial tool for modern software development and is widely used by developers and organizations around the world.

Here's a video from GitHub that explains a little more.

#### Key Features of GitHub

1. **Version Control:**
   - GitHub allows you to keep track of every change you make to your code, making it easy to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. This is particularly useful for debugging and improving your code over time.

2. **Collaboration:**
   - GitHub enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. You can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently and merge them back into the main project once they are ready.

3. **Project Management:**
   - GitHub provides tools for managing projects, such as issues, pull requests, and project boards. These features help you organize and prioritize tasks, discuss changes, and track progress.

4. **Code Sharing:**
   - GitHub makes it easy to share your code with others. You can create public repositories that anyone can view and contribute to or private repositories for more secure projects.

#### Why GitHub is Relevant for Intro to Programming Students

1. **Industry Standard:**
   - GitHub is widely used in the tech industry. Learning how to use GitHub effectively prepares you for real-world software development and makes you more attractive to potential employers.

2. **Collaboration Skills:**
   - Understanding how to collaborate on GitHub teaches you important teamwork skills. You will learn how to contribute to projects, review others' code, and manage different versions of a project.

3. **Code Management:**
   - GitHub helps you manage your code efficiently. You can track changes, experiment with new features without breaking your main project, and maintain a clean project history.

4. **Portfolio Building:**
   - By creating and maintaining repositories on GitHub, you can build a portfolio of your work. This portfolio showcases your skills and projects to potential employers or collaborators.

5. **Learning and Improvement:**
   - GitHub's open-source nature allows you to explore and contribute to existing projects. This exposure helps you learn from more experienced developers and improve your coding skills.

#### How to Get Started with GitHub

1. **Create an Account:**
   - Sign up for a free GitHub account at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

2. **Install Git:**
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Configure it with your username and email.

3. **Create a Repository:**
   - Start a new project by creating a repository. This will be the central place for all your project files and history.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Download a copy of the repository to your local machine to start working on it.

5. **Make Changes and Commit:**
   - Edit your files and commit your changes with meaningful messages. This keeps a record of what changes were made and why.

6. **Push Changes:**
   - Upload your commits to GitHub so that they are saved in your online repository.

7. **Collaborate:**
   - Invite others to collaborate on your project, create branches for new features, and use pull requests to review and merge changes.
