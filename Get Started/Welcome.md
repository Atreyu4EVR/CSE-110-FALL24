# Welcome to CSE-110 Intro to Programming

So, you've registered for an entry-level programming class? Depending on your background and interests, this is likely something brand new. You probably aren't even majoring in anything "tech-related." For some, software development is something that's already familiar and Python will come naturally. And others, like me, will struggle and take time to learn the concepts of "programming." Regardless of where you currently sit on the spectrum of "tech savviness," you're in the right course.

## Programming, Software Development, or Software Engineering?
Is it programming or software development? Or software engineering? Which is it? Let's make this simple though; all of the terms mean the same thing, but in slightly different ways. The potential variance in terminology isn't critical though. Throughout this semester, you'll hear me call it by any of those names. If you're studying computer science, you'll likely dive much deeper into the greater theory of software engineering, but for now, we're going to keep it simple—this is an intro course after all. Which way do you prefer? Sound off in our Teams channel (use code: 13ctta7) and let us know which term you use! Also, let us know if you have any programming experience in the channel and make sure to encourage your classmates!

## Welcome Message
Let me start off by welcoming you. You are in the right course, in fact, you're in the right place, studying at the right college, doing exactly what the Lord wants for you. Elder David A. Bednar was on campus once, sat in front of us (the body of faculty and admin), and explained how nothing "in the Gospel of Jesus Christ" is ever a coincidence. Being in this course is no exception—you're here for a reason. So, let's do this.

Hello—I'm Ron Vallejo and I'm excited to guide you into the vast and vibrant world of software development, beginning with the most popular programming language, Python. This course is designed not only for computer science majors but anyone curious about learning more about coding, technology, AI, etc. Here, you'll embark on a journey that not only teaches programming but also prepares you with the essential tools for today's digital workplace. 

## About Me
My name is Ron Vallejo. The school as asked faculty to have students refer to us as "brother" or sister" ... So feel free to call me Brother Vallejo. I appreciate the reason for this, but personally, I'd just have you call me Ron. 
 
Let's see, a little about me. Technology is a tremendous passion of mine and has been for as long as a can remember. BYU-Idaho has me serving as both a faculty member teaching Intro to Programming and as the Manager of the IT Service Desk team in our IT Department. So no matter what, I can't seem to escape technology. 

One thing to note about me: I take a lot of pride and satisfaction in teaching anything about tech, let alone Python and Artificial Intelligence. Having said that, I can teach IT concepts to just about anyone who's willing to learn. 

My background with is quite broad—ranging between managing daily IT operations and incident management, to hand-on device support, to developing AI chatbots using Python. 

A little bit about my personal life. I began my life here in Rexburg just over 10 years ago, as a freshman business student on campus. And about a year later, I fell in love with my wife, Bridget. Soon after we were married in the Idaho Falls, ID temple. We now have 5 kids: Mason 9, Alice 8, James 6, Jacob 3, and my baby Elsie 6 months. 

We reside here locally in Rexburg and are the proud owners of approxitaly 16 hens, and 1 glorius duck named "Daisy."
