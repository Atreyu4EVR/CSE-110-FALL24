        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully made it to the final lesson of CSE 110.</p>

        <p>During this course you have learned to write programs to solve meaningful problems in a variety of domains. This was the major outcome of this course.</p>

        <p>Another outcome of the course was for you to develop confidence that you can continue to learn new programming concepts. Even though it may have been challenging at times, you have shown skill in thinking analytically, breaking down problems into manageable pieces, working with others, and debugging abstract problems. These are skills that will transfer to any field of study or career path that you may choose.</p>

        <p>Because this outcome of developing confidence to successfully learn new programming concepts is so important, Lesson 14 is devoted to helping you reflect and assess where you are in that development process.</p>

        <p>To help you and the university reflect on the progress toward this outcome, you are asked to do three things during this lesson:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Write a personal reflection document.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Fill out an I-Learn Quiz as a self-assessment of this outcome.</p>
                <p>Your responses do not affect your grade, but it helps the course designers see how successful this course was at achieving its goals.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Take a short Qualtrics survey.</p>
                <p>Again, your responses don't affect your grade, but it helps the course designers compare course improvement progress from semester to semester.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
