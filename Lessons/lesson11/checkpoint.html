        <h1>11 Prepare: Checkpoint</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Practice Opening Files</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>For this assignment, you'll download the file <a href="books.txt" download>books.txt</a> that contains the names of the books in the Book of Mormon, and save it to your computer.</p>
        <p>Once you have the file saved to your computer, in VS Code, open the <em>folder</em> that contains it and create a new Python script.</p>
        <p>Have your program open the file, read through it line by line, strip off leading and trailing whitespace and display each book to the screen.</p>

        <p>The following shows the expected output:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
1 Nephi
2 Nephi
Jacob
Enos
Jarom
Omni
Words of Mormon
Mosiah
Alma
Helaman
3 Nephi
4 Nephi
Mormon
Ether
Moroni
</code></pre>

        <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
        <p>When your program is finished, please view a sample solution of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the sample solution. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the sample solution to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Sample solution: <a href="./check11_sample_py.html" target="_blank">check11_sample.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
        <p>For this program, there isn't any user input, so you don't need to try different values. Instead, simply verify that the following work as described</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The books.txt file is downloaded and saved to your computer.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your program can open the file.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your program reads a line from the file and displays it to the screen.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your program iterates through each line in the file and displays them to the screen.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your program strips off the "\n" characters at the end of each line before displaying them, so it doesn't produce a blank line in between each displayed line.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
