        <p>The following shows one way to solve this problem. It is not the <em>only</em> way this can be solved.</p>

"""
File: check11_sample.txt
Author: Brother Burton

Purpose: Demonstrate the basics of reading from a text file in Python.
"""

# Open the file.
# The "with" syntax makes it so I don't have to worry about closing it later
with open("books.txt") as book_file:

    # Go through each line in the file, one by one
    for line in book_file:
        # The .strip() function returns a new line that doesn't have leading
        # or trailing whitespace. In other words, it strips off the "\n" that
        # would otherwise be at the end of each line.
