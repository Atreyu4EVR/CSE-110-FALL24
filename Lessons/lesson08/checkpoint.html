        <h1>08 Prepare: Checkpoint</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Demonstrate your understand of <code>for</code> loops.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>Write a Python Program that does each of the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Given the following list of items (copy and paste this line into your program):</p>
<pre><code class="python">
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
</code></pre>
            <p>Use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through this list one by one and display each item on its own line as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
red
blue
green
yellow
</code></pre>
                
            </li>

            <li><p>Use a <code>for</code> loop to display the numbers 1&ndash;8, one number on each line as follows:</p></li>

<pre><code class="bash">
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</code></pre>

            <li><p>Use a <code>for</code> loop to display the even numbers (hint: count by two) 2&ndash;20, one number on each line as follows:</p></li>

<pre><code class="bash">
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
</code></pre>


        <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
        <p>When your program is finished, please view a sample solution of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the sample solution. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the sample solution to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Sample solution: <a href="./check08_sample_py.html" target="_blank">check08_sample.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
        <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step in this testing procedure:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Verify that the colors display as desired.</p></li>
            <li><p>Verify that your output for part 2 does <strong>not</strong> include 0.</p></li>
            <li><p>Verify that your output for part 2 does <strong>not</strong> include 9.</p></li>
            <li><p>Verify that your output for part 3 does <strong>not</strong> include any odd numbers.</p></li>
            <li><p>Verify that your output for part 3 starts at 2 and ends at 20.</p></li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
