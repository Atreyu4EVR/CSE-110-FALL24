        <h1>13 Prepare: Checkpoint</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This checkpoint is designed to help you practice writing basic functions.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>Write three functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><code>display_regular</code>&mdash;Receives a string and prints it out, exactly as received.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>display_uppercase</code>&mdash;Receives a string, converts it to upper case, and then prints it out.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>display_lowercase</code>&mdash;Receives a string, converts it to lower case, and then prints it out.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>In your program below the functions, ask the user to type a message. Then, pass that message to each of the three functions, so it it displays it each way, as shown:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
What is your message? <span class="user-input">Brother Burton</span>
Brother Burton
BROTHER BURTON
brother burton
</code></pre>

        <p>Another example is:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
What is your message? <span class="user-input">The only thing we have to fear is FEAR itself!</span>
The only thing we have to fear is FEAR itself!
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF!
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself!
</code></pre>


        <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
        <p>When your program is finished, please view a sample solution of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the sample solution. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the sample solution to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Sample solution: <a href="./check13_sample_py.html" target="_blank">check13_sample.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
        <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step in this testing procedure:</p>

        <p>Try your program with each of the following conditions and ensure that it works as expected.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>A single word</p></li>
            <li><p>A phrase with multiple words</p></li>
            <li><p>A word in ALL CAPS</p></li>
            <li><p>A phrase where each word starts with a capital</p></li>
            <li><p>An empty string</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
