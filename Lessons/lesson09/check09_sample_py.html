File: check09_sample.py
Author: Brother Burton

Purpose: Practice using lists, by adding the names of friends.
"""

# First, I'm going to set up an empty list called, friends.
# Notice that I call it friends (with an s) not friend. This will help me
# remember throughout my code that it is a list of potentially many friends
# rather than a single friend.
friends = []

# This will be used in my loop to get the name of each friend that I want
# to put in the list. I can start it will any value, as long as that value
# is not "end", otherwise, it won't ever go into the loop I made to gather
# the names.
name = None

while name != "end":
    name = input("Type the name of a friend: ")

    # Without this if statement, I would put "end" into my list as well
    if name != "end":
        friends.append(name)

print()
print("Your friends are:")

# Now I'm going to loop through them each one at a time to display them.
# Notice that the list is called "friends" (with an s) but as I go through
# it I'm going to refer to each individual name as "friend" (no s)
for friend in friends:
    print(friend)
