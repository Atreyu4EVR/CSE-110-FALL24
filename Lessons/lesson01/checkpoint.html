        <h1>01 Prepare: Checkpoint</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Write and run your first program.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>It is a tradition in almost all programming classes to begin by creating a program that displays the words "Hello World!" to the screen. We will continue that tradition in this assignment.</p>

        <p>Write a Python Program that displays the following to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
Hello World!
</code></pre>

        <h2>Instructor Code</h2>
        <p>When your program is finished, please view the instructor's version of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the instructor code. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the instructor code to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Instructor code: <a href="./check01_instructor_py.html" target="_blank">check01_instructor.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
