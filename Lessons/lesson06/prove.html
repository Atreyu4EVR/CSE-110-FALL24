        <h1>06 Prove: Assignment - Adventure Game</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For this lesson, you need to finish the Adventure Game that you began in Lesson 05.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Please review the <a href="../lesson05/prove.html" target="_blank">assignment requirements</a> defined in Lesson 05.</p>

        <p>Your assignment this week is to finish the remaining requirements, including adding something to show creativity and exceed the core requirements.</p>

        <p>Don't forget about the extra credit opportunity of showing your program to two other people and explaining how it works.</p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>To submit your assignment, you need to do three things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Upload your program (the .py file) to I-Learn for feedback.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading category that best describes your assignment along with a 1&ndash;2 sentence justification for your choice. (Make sure to highlight anything you did to show creativity and exceed requirements!) The grading criteria are as follows:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><p>1 = Some attempt made</p></li>
                    <li><p>2 = Developing (but significantly deficient)</p></li>
                    <li><p>3 = Slightly deficient</p></li>
                    <li><p>4 = Meets requirements</p></li>
                    <li><p>5 = Shows creativity and exceeds requirements</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            <li><p>If you completed the extra credit opportunity, in your submission comments, please briefly describe your experience.</p></li>
        </ol>
