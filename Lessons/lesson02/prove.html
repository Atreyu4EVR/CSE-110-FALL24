        <h1>02 Prove: Assignment - Word Games</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs" target="_blank">Mad Libs</a> are a type of funny story, where a person is asked for words without knowing their context. The words are then placed into a story in a pre-determined format, often resulting in funny statements.</p>

        <p>For example, consider prompts for:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Plural noun</p></li>
            <li><p>Verb</p></li>
            <li><p>Adjective</p></li>
            <li><p>Noun</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>And a story, such as:</p>

        <p><em>When it comes to [plural-noun], you would never want to [verb], especially if you encountered a [adjective] [noun].</em></p>

        <p>A person, may respond to the prompts with the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Plural noun: ducks</p></li>
            <li><p>Verb: jump</p></li>
            <li><p>Adjective: cold</p></li>
            <li><p>Noun: taco</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then the story would read:</p>

        <p><em>When it comes to ducks, you would never want to jump, especially if you encountered a cold taco.</em></p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>For this assignment, you will implement a program that asks the user for a series of words and then displays the story with the user's words inserted into the appropriate places.</p>

        <p>The program should begin by asking the user for each of the words. It should then, fill those words into the appropriate places in the story.</p>

        <p>To begin, please use the following story:</p>

        <p>The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very<br> <em>[adjective]</em>
            <em>[animal]</em> <em>[verb]</em> down the hallway. "<em>[exclamation]</em>!" I yelled. But all<br>
            I could think to do was to <em>[verb]</em> over and over. Miraculously,<br>that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to <em>[verb]</em><br>right in front of my family.</p>

        <p>Make sure to match the punctuation and spacing of the original story exactly (for example, you should not put your words on their own line, they should fit naturally into the story).</p>
        <p>Also, make it so that the "exclamation" word is automatically capitalized, because it starts a new sentence.</p>

        <h3>Sample Output</h3>
        <p>Here is an example of how your program might work:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">
Please enter the following:

adjective: <span class="user-input">happy</span>
animal: <span class="user-input">zebra</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">sneeze</span>
exclamation: <span class="user-input">hooray</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">read</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">drive</span>

Your story is:

The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
happy zebra sneeze down the hallway. "Hooray!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to read over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to drive
right in front of my family. 
</code></pre>

<p>Another example, where the user typed different values might look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
Please enter the following:

adjective: <span class="user-input">tired</span>
animal: <span class="user-input">snail</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">yell</span>
exclamation: <span class="user-input">oh no</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">sing</span>
verb: <span class="user-input">skip</span>

Your story is:

The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
tired snail yell down the hallway. "Oh no!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to sing over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to skip
right in front of my family. 
</code></pre>

        <h2>Showing Creativity and Exceeding Requirements</h2>
        <p>For this assignment, show creativity and exceed the core requirements by adding more to the story, including several more words that will be filled in.</p>

        <p>If you have previous experience with topics that we will see later in the semester, consider a sentence that has an "a" or "an" in front of your word, and let the program fill in the right one.</p>

        <p>Anything else you can think of is also fair game. Remember, the goal here is to experiment with different ideas and to have fun.</p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>To submit your assignment, you need to do two things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Upload your program (the .py file) to I-Learn for feedback.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading category that best describes your assignment along with a 1&ndash;2 sentence justification for your choice. (Make sure to highlight anything you did to show creativity and exceed requirements!) The grading criteria are as follows:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><p>1 = Some attempt made</p></li>
                    <li><p>2 = Developing (but significantly deficient)</p></li>
                    <li><p>3 = Slightly deficient</p></li>
                    <li><p>4 = Meets requirements</p></li>
                    <li><p>5 = Shows creativity and exceeds requirements</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
        </ol>
