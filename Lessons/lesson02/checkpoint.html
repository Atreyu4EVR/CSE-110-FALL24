        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>An iconic line from the James Bond movies is that he would introduce himself as "Bond, James Bond." For this assignment you will write a program that asks for your name and repeats it back in this way.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>Prompt the user for their first name. Then, prompt them for their last name. Display the text back all on one line saying, "Your name is last-name, first-name, last-name" as shown:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
What is your first name? <span class="user-input">Scott</span>
What is your last name? <span class="user-input">Burton</span>

Your name is Burton, Scott Burton.
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">
What is your first name? <span class="user-input">Brigham</span>
What is your last name? <span class="user-input">Young</span>

Your name is Young, Brigham Young.
</code></pre>

        <p><em>Make sure to be precise!</em> You should have the spacing, comma, and period appear exactly as shown in the examples.</p>

        <h2>Instructor Code</h2>
        <p>When your program is finished, please view the instructor's version of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the instructor code. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the instructor code to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Instructor code: <a href="./check02_instructor_py.html" target="_blank">check02_instructor.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
