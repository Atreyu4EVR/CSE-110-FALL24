        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, you will continue working with loops and learning how to solve more complex problems.</p>

        <h2>Preparation Material</h2>
        <p>In the previous lesson, you learned about <code>while</code> loops. In this lesson, you will build on that foundation to learn about another kind of loop called a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

        <p>Watch the following videos which discuss both kinds of loops:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrOAl8vUFHY&list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6&index=27" target="_blank">Loops</a> (5 mins)</p></li>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvD-6MpTw4&list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6&index=28" target="_blank">Demo: Loops</a> (3 mins)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>As shown, there are a few different ways you can tell the computer to loop through code over and over again.</p>

        <h3>Looping through a list</h3>
        <p>One example of looping, is to loop, or iterate, through each item of a collection or a list, one at a time. You will learn about lists in more detail in future lessons, but the following shows an example of looping through a list of words to print them on the screen one at a time:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
items = ["crayon", "scissors", "paper", "glitter glue", "markers", "pens"]

for item in items:
    print(f"The item is: {item}")
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this code is:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
The item is: crayon
The item is: scissors
The item is: paper
The item is: glitter glue
The item is: markers
The item is: pens    
</code></pre>        

        <p>Just as with <code>if</code> statements, the colon <code>:</code> at the end of your <code>for</code> statement tells the computer that there is a block of code coming. Then, you indent all the code that is in the block. The code that is indented is the code that will be run on each item.</p>

        <p>When looping through each item, you can do much more with it than simply printing it out. You could include an <code>if</code> statement, to check if it meets certain conditions, and then use it in a math expression, or anything else that you've learned how to do in your programs.</p>

        <aside class="stay-middle"><heading>Frequently Asked Questions:</heading>
            <p>What about the variable <code>item</code>? Is that a special name? Where does it get defined?</p>
            <p>There is nothing special about the name <code>item</code> in this case. It could have just as easily been called <code>thing</code> or <code>writing_instrument</code>.</p>
            <p>The for loop syntax here is very clever. When you type <code>for item in items:</code>, the list variable, <code>items</code> must already exist, but the variable for each individual element of the list, in this case <code>item</code>, is defined right in that statement. In short, it's saying, "Go through each element of this list and assign a new variable <code>item</code> to be the value each time through.</p>
            
        </aside>


        <h3>Looping through numbers</h3>
        <p>It's very common in programming to want to loop through a series of numbers. You could create a list of numbers, just like the list of words in the last example, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
</code></pre>        

        <p>But this could get really long if you wanted to work with a large amount of numbers, so there is an easier way, using <code>range</code>.</p>

        <p>You can create the same list of numbers like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
numbers = range(10)
</code></pre>

        <p>This creates a list of numbers for you that starts at <code>0</code> and goes up until (but not including) <code>10</code>.</p>

        <p>You could assign this list to a variable like <code>numbers</code> as in the example above, and then loop through each number in the list of numbers, but it is more common to just put the <code>range</code> code right in your for loop like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
for number in range(10):
    print(number)
</code></pre>

        <p>The output of this code is:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</code></pre>

        <aside class="stay-middle"><heading>Hint from Instructor:</heading>
            <p>In programming languages we usually start counting at 0 instead of 1. There are reasons for this, but more than anything, it's just something you'll have to get use to.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>The <code>range</code> function gives you other options like starting at a different number, or counting by 3's, or even going backwards. In all of these cases, the idea of looping through the values is the same. You start with the first one and then continue on, one by one, through the list.</p>

        <p>To start with a different number, you provide two values to the <code>range</code> function. If you provide two numbers, it will start with the first one and continue up until (but not including) the second one.</p>

        <p>If you provide three values to the <code>range</code> function, it will use the third number as the "step size" or in other words the number to count by.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# This loop will start with 100, and go up to, but not including 200
for i in range(100, 200):
    print(i)

# This loop will do the same thing, but this time, it will count by 10's
for i in range(100, 200, 10):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Loops within loops</h3>
        <p>A loop will blindly repeat any code that is in its body. That code could include if statement, mathematics, new variable definitions, or anything else&mdash;including other loops!</p>

        <p>The following example displays the numbers 0-4:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
</code></pre>

        <p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">
0
1
2
3
4
</code></pre>

        <p>We can add a second, inner loop, that for each one of those displays the numbers 10-12 (with two <code>-</code> characters in front to make it easier to visualize).</p>


<pre><code class="python">
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    for j in range(10, 13):
        print(f"--{j}")
</code></pre>

        <p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">
0
--10
--11
--12
1
--10
--11
--12
2
--10
--11
--12
3
--10
--11
--12
4
--10
--11
--12
</code></pre>

        <p>Notice how the inner loop is run every time the outer loop displays it's number. Inner loops can be very helpful in iterating through a two-dimensional structure, such as the pixels in an image.</p>

        <aside class="stay-middle"><heading>Hint from Instructor:</heading>
            <p>While we generally prefer variable names that are more descriptive than a single letter, if the variable will only be used for counting in a simple loop it is considered standard to use <code>i</code>. Then, if you have an inner loop, you use <code>j</code>, and a third inner loop would be <code>k</code>. If you have more than three loops you should consider if there is a simpler way to accomplish your task, and if there really isn't, you should at least move to more descriptive variable names at that point.</p>

        <h3>Updating Variables in Loops</h3>

        <p>A common task with loops is to use each value together to solve a problem. For example, you may want to find the largest charge in your account, or the average of all of them. Sometimes this can be a little challenging, because you have to think beyond each line one at a time, and think about how they will play together as they repeat.</p>

        <p>You will see more of these examples in future lessons as you learn more about lists. But for now, it is important to visualize how a variable can be changed in each iteration of the loop.</p>

        <p>Consider the following example where the numbers 1&ndash;5 are displayed to the screen:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"i={i}")
</code></pre>

        <p>The output of that code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
i=1
i=2
i=3
i=4
i=5
</code></pre>

        <p>If you create a variable before the loop and print it out each time, you can see that its value doesn't change:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
x = 25

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"i={i}, x={x}")
</code></pre>

        <p>The output of that code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
i=1, x=25
i=2, x=25
i=3, x=25
i=4, x=25
i=5, x=25
</code></pre>

        <p>So far so good.</p>

        <p>Now, watch what happens as we add one to the value <code>x</code> each time through the loop:</p>

        <p>The code <code>x = x + 1</code> says, x is going to get the value of whatever it was before plus 1.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
x = 25

for i in range(1, 6):
    x = x + 1
    print(f"i={i}, x={x}")

print(f"The final value of x is: {x}")
</code></pre>

        <p>The output of that code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
i=1, x=26
i=2, x=27
i=3, x=28
i=4, x=29
i=5, x=30
The final value of x is: 30
</code></pre>

        <p>Notice that at the end of the code, x now has the value 30. Each time through the loop the <code>x = x + 1</code> line increased its value by one, and in the end, it ran 5 times, so the value has increased from 25 to 30.</p>

        <p>Instead of starting it at 25 and adding 1 each time. You could start it at 0 and add the number <code>i</code> to it:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
x = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    x = x + i
    print(f"i={i}, x={x}")

print(f"The final value of x is: {x}")
</code></pre>

<p>The output of that code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plaintext">
i=1, x=1
i=2, x=3
i=3, x=6
i=4, x=10
i=5, x=15
The final value of x is: 15
</code></pre>

        <p>The variable x has effectively added up, or summed, all the numbers you looped through.</p>

        <p>At this point, you could divide by the number of items to get the average, or you could add some if statements to try to find the maximum value, etc. These are topics you'll explore in more detail in future weeks.</p>
